Tools to apply theoretical constraints of orbital stability and tidal migration to KOI exomoon candidates.  

This is a repository for tools to apply known theoretical constraints of orbital stability and tidal migration to KOI exomoon candidates. 
Orbital stability contraints provide critical semimJor axis (a_c), of exomoons in terms of AU. And orbital evolution with different tidal constants (Q) and mass ratios. 

Included are: 
xxx.py-applies tidal migration analysis using plausible parameters from the solar system and plots angular velocity over time. Similar to figure 1 from Sasaki et al.(2012); it determines the time evolution of the spin angular momentum of the planet (omega_p) and the orbital mean motion of the planet and the moon (nu_p and nu_m, respectively). 
xxx.py-implements decision tree algorithm to calculate the migration time scale (T1) and the total migration time scale (T). Both T1 and T are calculated and plotted as vertical and horizontal lines withing the angular velocity evolution plot. 
xxx.py- produces figure 3 from Quarles et al. 2020, which [...not sure what else to write]. 

[should i describe the data? specify to run the code? ]
